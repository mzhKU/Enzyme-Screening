# DESCRIPTION:
# Scripts developed under IRENE project.

# AUTHOR:
# Martin Hediger, Copenhagen University
# 
# USAGE:
# Documented in tutorial_screening.pdf
#
# NOTE:
# The scripts belong to one of the two categories:
# - Data production is related to all steps required for setting up
#   and carrying out calculations using the MOPAC program.
# - Data processing is concerned with the steps to analyse the data
#   produced.
# The scripts are described roughly in order of usage. Caution is required
# in the usage of the scripts because they
# a) Could potentially overwrite CPU costly output
# b) In some cases require adjustment of keywords which are required
#    for parsing input.

# Scripts Data Production
- 'seq_files.py'    : Generate back bone sequence files.
- 'vsc.py'          : V-ariant s-ide c-hain file generation from PyMOL. Point
                      mutations are entered in this script.
- 'avf.py'          : A-ssemble V-ariant F-iles.
- 'cha2scf.sh'      : Charge to scf calculation transfer.
- 'fix.py'          : Script to constrain side chains.
- 'intcat.sh'       : Interpolate between two structures, concatenate frames.
- 'intcha.sh'       : Interpolate between two structures and write keyword for
                      MOPAC charge determination.  
- 'scf2opt.sh'      : Write MOPAC input for optimization based on SCF output.
- 'opt2spe.sh'      : Transfer structure data from optimization to MOPAC
                      SPE input file.

# Scripts Data Processing
- 'profiles.py'     : Extract heat of formation from MOPAC output files
                      and write a file for each unique mutant.
- 'ext_rest_barrier': Extract barriers.
- 'plots.py'        : Write gnuplot files for plotting blocks
                      related of mutants.
- 'vec.py'          : Script used in order to analyze partial Hessian
                      vibrational analysis.
